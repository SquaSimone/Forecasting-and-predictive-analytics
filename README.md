For our forecasting and predictive analytics course project, my colleague and I delved into the realm of a imaginary consulting firm specializing in health research. 
This firm operates in collaboration with various partners, including both private and public international institutions. Our project involved an in-depth exploration of the firm's 
methodologies and practices within the dynamic landscape of health research consultancy.

Our efforts were concentrated on three distinct projects, each situated within specific analytical frameworks:
1) A project focused on regression analysis, aimed at uncovering relationships and patterns within the data.
2) A project centered around classification techniques, aiming to categorize and classify data points based on various attributes.
3) A project within the domain of time series analysis, dedicated to forecasting and understanding trends over time.
